# MNIST_Classification_Study
Use of random forest to classify digits in the MNIST dataset

This notebook is the presentation of work done for a class during my time working on my Master's, and as such has been cleaned of any content that was specific to the course out of respect for the professor.

The core objective was a threshold of accuracy set by the professor, with some parameters frozen in advance and some classification systems off-limits. As presented, it used a random forest to classify the digits, but in order to increase the accuracy the digits were presented as binary options, classified as such, and then those classification probabilities adopted into a framework for choosing the most likely candidate.
